# About Me

Hi, I'm {{ site.author.name }} :wave:<br>

I studied environmental science earning a triple major in agriculture and natural resource management, wildlife ecology, and entomology at the University of Delaware. After taking a course in geographical information systems, I also became deeply interested in mapping and cartography.

I was able to grow my knowledge in both environmental science and mapping while working on natural resource protection, regulatory compliance, and siting projects at consulting and engineering firms. I expanded my skillset while working at a geospatial software company, contributing to community projects that had a positive civic, social, and environmental impact.

Now, I'm excited to be able to apply my experience to focus on land and natural resource protection at a nonprofit land trust.

I love to learn, and spend most of my free time [after the baby goes to sleep] studying new software technologies, building my knowledge in programming, and designing maps.
