# 20 Second Facts

The first components of the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) were launched in 1998 and the station was first occupied in November of 2000. Since then, 239 people from 19 countries have visited the ISS, many multiple times.

The total time since humans first entered the ISS is captured in several time categories. Total inhabited orbits around the Earth is also calculated, based on an average 15.54 orbits per day.
