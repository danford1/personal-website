# inhabited

Based off open source projects [jake-quits](https://github.com/jakealbaugh/jake-quits) and [detoxicated](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/detoxicated), this website counts the total time that humans have continuously inhabited space.

The first components of the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) were launched in 1998 and the station was first occupied in November of 2000. Since then, 239 people from 19 countries have visited the ISS, many multiple times.

This website uses JavaScript to calculate the total time since humans first entered the ISS and renders several time categories. Total inhabited orbits around the Earth is also calculated, based on an average 15.54 orbits per day.
