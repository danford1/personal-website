<p>In early 2019, my daughter was born and, as cliche as it sounds, my life changed forever.</p>

<p>Much of my focus shifted inward on my little family. We got in a pretty good pattern over just a few weeks. I would wake up early morning, feed my daughter, and hold her in my arms for an hour or two before leaving for work. I would often have my computer in my lap, working on my map art side hustle. I would describe what I was doing; why I was doing it; what I was learning.</p>

<p>This quiet time was so important to me. I looked forward to it every night as I went to bed. It was just the two of us all alone as the sun came up, learning and growing together.</p>

<p>In the evening, we read books. So many books. I became fascinated by a specific format that is becoming popular - a growing number of board books that condense complex concepts for babies.</p>

<p>My interest in that style synthesized with my early morning routine as I softly narrated descriptions of what maps and cartography taught us about our planet. I started to talk to my daughter in patterns that mimicked the short phrasing in children’s books as I explained concepts that we normally learn much later in life.</p>

<p>The following autumn, my wife and I decided to make homemade gifts for my daughter for her first holiday season.</p>

<p>My wife sketched, cut, sewed, and stitched a full garden of vegetables made from felt. I’m glad my daughter has that beautiful felt garden as an example of what vegetables look like, since our backyard garden harvest this year was four cucumbers… (it’s the soil. it has to be the soil. I’ll add some amendments before next season…)</p>

<p>Knowing my wife was making such an awesome gift inspired me to come up with a unique idea to create for my daughter. I brainstormed some different projects, and kept circling back around to the topic of maps (of course).</p>

<p>I already had narrations of map themes in my head from our early morning snuggle time. From the start of ideation, I was drawn towards the concept of map projections - the calculations by which we transform the globular ellipsoid (read: round) Planet Earth into flat maps.</p>

<p>This topic is centered on advanced math and inherently complicated. To me, at least. I by no means had an expert understanding of the subject. But, I felt like I could translate the topic to infants. I mean, I already outlined map projections for my daughter in our morning chats, including a glowing review of the widespread use of web mercator…</p>

<p>The idea for “Map Projections for Babies” was born.</p>

<p>Over the course of the month of November 2019 I wrote and illustrated the first draft of “Map Projections for Babies” for my daughter.</p>

<figure class="figure w-100">
  <img src="/assets/images/posts/post-book-story-01.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="The first copy of Map Projections for Babies" /><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The first copy of Map Projections for Babies, a gift for my daughter</figcaption></figure>

<p>I started by outlining the manuscript and framing out the illustrations. I used open data from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> to create the images and open source processing pipelines to project the spatial data in different shapes.</p>

<p>I chose a minimalistic color scheme. While there isn’t a significant level of contrast between the greens and blues used in a majority of the illustrations, the maps are clearly discernible from the white background. The color choices offer interesting and recognizable land/water distinctions for adult readers, while providing captivating shapes for infants.</p>

<p>I shared the book with a few parents and members of the geospatial community and they expressed interest in getting a copy of the book. I decided to set up an all-or-nothing crowdfunding campaign to create an opportunity for the community to raise funds for a first print run at no risk to Backers.</p>

<p>After receiving input from editors, I finalized the design and ordered sample copies from the printer. I worked with a printer based in the U.S. that focuses on quality and safety. A 100% United States supply chain helped ensure that the process of ordering the books was as efficient as possible. With pandemic-related impacts around globe, I tried to keep as much of the process local as possible.</p>

<p>As part of the Kickstarter project, I decided to create some unique rewards. Backers can pair their book order with a onesie with the phrase “I Love Maps” spelled in a toy block design or a map art print that features unique projections of a shaded relief Earth. Contributors can also choose to order different quantities of the first edition board book. Special discounted rewards will be available throughout the campaign.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in supporting this campaign to bring Map Projections for Babies to as many families as possible, visit the Kickstarter project and select a reward.</p>

<p>The crowdfunding campaign launches on GIS Day, November 18th, 2020 and closes at midnight on December 18th, 2020. Books and other rewards will arrive in April 2021.</p>

<p>In 2020, a first print run of the book was made possible with the support of 352 Kickstarter Backers.</p>

<h2 id="the-book">The book</h2>

<p>Map Projections for Babies is a board book that explains how we unwrap the round Earth to make flat maps. Vibrant illustrations show unique map projection examples, ranging from common shapes - like circles and squares - to intricate shapes - like hearts and butterflies. The book describes the way size, shape, and distance change on different projections.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>I truly appreciate the community support this project has received so far and I hope that this book will spark a curiosity for learning that will grow along with Baby.</p>
