At nonprofit conservation organizations, your team's level of impact is limited by available staff time and money. One way to maximize these limited resources is by building out a tech stack - a group of [software-as-a-service (SaaS) products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) - to support several aspects of your work.

By leveraging software for repeatable workflows, you can improve the efficiency and accuracy of your work and realize positive effects like greater reach and impact.

Let's talk about where you can incorporate tech tools into your work, how to choose the right tools for your team, and examples of opportunities where products can improve your work and therefore, your impact.

## What is a tech stack?

A tech stack is a suite of software products or other tech tools that an organization utilizes to accomplish their work. Ideally, you can identify common needs between different workflows and select products that can be integrated.

Most of us use a tech stack in our daily lives; something like an email client, internet browser, and calendar. These common tech tools can share information back and forth to improve your communication workflow.

You can build a tech stack specific to your conservation work. At a nonprofit land trust, you might want to select software to support land acquisition real estate transactions, habitat stewardship project work, or constituent communications.

## Why build out a tech stack?

**Save yourself time.**

Land trust work involves so many


 Managing processes, data, and reporting can be a full time job in and of itself. 

Let's say you’re responsible for annual monitoring of protected lands. Comm need to communicate with land owners




**Save yourself money.**

Offboard the work to experts that can focus on creating the product solution and maintaining the software.


**Foster team work**
Consider tools for each specific type of work at your conservation organization: development/fundraising, accounting, HR/people, communications, community management, property acquisition, stewardship/monitoring, data management, etc. Even within each of these categories you may find that multiple tools are helpful.

You’ll really start to achieve new levels of impact when you implement a series of ~connected~ tools. If the Communications Team can view a pipeline of land preservation projects, they can plan announcements ahead of time. If the Land Stewards can view Development Team info, they can inform their conversations with the land owner who just became a member.

An integrated tech stack is the holy grail of achieving greater impact.


## How can you go about creating your tech stack?

First, evaluate your current processes and consider if the workflows themselves need to be improved. For example, if you're currently managing property paperwork

1. Compare products: consider features, UI/UX, pricing, integrations

2. Interview users: talk to others using the product

3. Test product: relevant team members participate in trial period

4. Integrate with workflows: implement use of product in workflows, following defined onboarding strategy
