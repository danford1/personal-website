Mapbox provides a tutorial on how to [place the geocoder input outside the map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mapbox-gl-geocoder-outside-the-map/). But what if you want to render the geocoder input and map on a different screen or app state?

This method uses CSS to render the visibility of the map and geocoder address search input separately
